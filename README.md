# writingBackup

WIP small commandline tool to back up a writing project inside a git repo to a second location, combine files, build citations, etc.  Because I have a bunch of writing projects with pieces strewn about many different files and inside private git repositories, and I want at least one other cloud backup location for them, but conventional wisdom is that it's a terrible idea to put git repos in dropbox etc.  So I'ma gonna have a backup system. 

Some of the code (for getting pandoc to run) adapted (i.e., swiped) from [https://github.com/RockfordWei/PanDoc](https://github.com/RockfordWei/PanDoc).
